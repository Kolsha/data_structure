### Recursion
[Recursion](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-i/) usually involves some kind of backtracking to enumerate all possibilities.

Note that Recursion is a more general purpose algorithm. [Depth-First search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) is a specific form of backtracking related to searching tree data structures. Therefore we categorize those problems in "Trees and Graphs", even though they involve recursion.

For a great introduction of how backtracking works, please check out [LeetCode's Recursion II card](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-ii/). A great example is "Word Search II" (aka the Boggle solver), which uses a data structure to optimize the search.
