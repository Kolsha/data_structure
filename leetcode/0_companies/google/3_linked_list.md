### Linked Lists
According to our user survey data, Linked List problems are not asked frequently at Google. Perhaps, most linked list problems are not that complex and it is harder to ask follow up and complexity analysis questions

Nonetheless, we strongly recommend you to still practice classic Linked List interview questions such as: [Linked List Cycle](), [Intersection of Two Linked Lists](), and [Copy List with Random Pointers](). These problems are really fun and they teach you how to think outside of the box.

Of course, [Merge k Sorted Lists]() is one of our all-time favorite interview questions, and Google seems to love this question as well. Make sure you understand how to analyze the time complexity! This is a common follow up question for this problem.
