### Trees and Graphs
Tree is just a special case of graph. To understand the difference between trees and graphs, you can work on [Graph Valid Tree](./../../graph/graph_valid_tree.md).

Graphs are generally breath-first search or depth-first search. The same applies to Trees, but trees never contain cycles.

Graphs are generally more complex than trees. Similarly, trees are generally more complex than linear data structures, such as arrays or linked lists.

Prepping your knowledge in Graphs is essential for Google interviews as you would most likely encounter a tree or a graph question. A great way to brush up your skills in this area is to implement a tree or graph by coding it from scratch in the [Playground](https://leetcode.com/playground).
