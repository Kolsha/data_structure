### 1. Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

Solution

Method 1: One Pass HashMap

It turns out we can do it in one-pass. While we iterate and inserting elements into the table, we also look back to check if current element's complement already exists in the table. If it exists, we have found a solution and return immediately.

```
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
```
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] res = new int[2];
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                res[1] = map.get(complement);
                res[0] = i;
                return res;
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
