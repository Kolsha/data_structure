### 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/

Let's call an array arr a mountain if the following properties hold:

arr.length >= 3
There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... arr[i-1] < arr[i]
arr[i] > arr[i+1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
Given an integer array arr that is guaranteed to be a mountain, return any i such that arr[0] < arr[1] < ... arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1].

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
Output: 1
Example 4:

Input: arr = [3,4,5,1]
Output: 2
Example 5:

Input: arr = [24,69,100,99,79,78,67,36,26,19]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 104
0 <= arr[i] <= 106
arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.

Approach 1: Linear Scan
Intuition and Algorithm

The mountain increases until it doesn't. The point at which it stops increasing is the peak.

```java
class Solution {
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] A) {
        int i = 0;
        while (A[i] < A[i+1]) i++;
        return i;
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N)O(N), where NN is the length of A.

Space Complexity: O(1)O(1).

Approach 2: Binary Search
Intuition and Algorithm

The comparison A[i] < A[i+1] in a mountain array looks like [True, True, True, ..., True, False, False, ..., False]: 1 or more boolean Trues, followed by 1 or more boolean False. For example, in the mountain array [1, 2, 3, 4, 1], the comparisons A[i] < A[i+1] would be True, True, True, False.

We can binary search over this array of comparisons, to find the largest index i such that A[i] < A[i+1]. For more on binary search, see the [LeetCode explore topic here](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/).

```java
class Solution {
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] A) {
        int lo = 0, hi = A.length - 1;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mi = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (A[mi] < A[mi + 1])
                lo = mi + 1;
            else
                hi = mi;
        }
        return lo;
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(\log N)O(logN), where NN is the length of A.
