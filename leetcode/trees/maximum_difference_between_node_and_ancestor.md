### 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor of B.

(A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.)

Example 1:

```
Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
```

Note:

1. The number of nodes in the tree is between 2 and 5000.
2. Each node will have value between 0 and 100000.

Solution

Method 1: Recursive

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int maxAncestorDiff(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root, root.val, root.val);
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode root, int min, int max) {
        if(root == null) {
            return max - min;
        }
        
        max = Math.max(max, root.val);
        min = Math.min(min, root.val);
        return Math.max(dfs(root.left, min, max), dfs(root.right, min, max));
    }
}
```
