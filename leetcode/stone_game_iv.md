Solution
Overview
You probably can guess from the problem title, this is the fourth problem in the series of Stone Game problems. Those problems are similar, but have considerable differences, making their solutions quite different. It's highly recommended to finish them all.

Here, two approaches are introduced: DFS with memorization and DP approach.

Approach 1: DFS with memorization
Intuition

First, let's analyze the problem.

According to Zermelo's_theorem, given n stones, either Alice has a must-win strategy, or Bob has one. Therefore, for Alice, the current state is either "must-win" or "must-lose". But how to determine which one it is?

For convenience, in the following context, "the current player" refers to the player now removing the stones, and "state i" refers to when there is i stones remaining.

Now the problem asks whether the current player will win in state n.

If we can go to a known state where Bob must lose, then we know Alice must win in the current state. All Alice has to do is to move the corresponding number of stones to go to that state. Therefore we need to find out which state Bob must lose.

Note that after going to the next state, Bob becomes the player removing the stones, which is the position of Alice in the current state. Therefore, to find out whether Bob will lose in the next state, we just need to check whether our function gives False for remaining stones.

Algorithm

Let function dfs(remain) represents whether the current player must win with remain stones remaining.

To find out the result of dfs(n), we need to iterate k from 0 to check whether there exits dfs(remain - k*k)==False. To prevent redundant calculate, use a map to store the result of dfs function.

Don't forget the base case dfs(0)==False and dfs(1)==True.

Note: After reading the Algorithm part, it is recommended to try to write the code on your own before reading the solution code.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        HashMap<Integer, Boolean> cache = new HashMap<>();
        cache.put(0, false);
        return dfs(cache, n);
    }

    public static boolean dfs(HashMap<Integer, Boolean> cache, int remain) {
        if (cache.containsKey(remain)) {
            return cache.get(remain);
        }
        int sqrt_root = (int) Math.sqrt(remain);
        for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt_root; i++) {
            // if there is any chance to make the opponent lose the game in the next round,
            // then the current player will win.
            if (!dfs(cache, remain - i * i)) {
                cache.put(remain, true);
                return true;
            }
        }
        cache.put(remain, false);
        return false;
    }
}
```

There some tricks that we used in the code above.

In the Python code, we use @lru_cache instead of a map to store the result of dfs. It's a useful grammar sugar in Python.

In the Java code, we don't have things like @lru_cache in Python, so here we use a simple HashMap. However, we can still use some tricks, if you want -- using an array instead of a map: we can use 0 to mark the unvisited nodes, use 1 to mark the true results, and use 2 to mark the false results. Also, we can just use an array of bytes, which uses less memory than an array of ints.

Note that the speed would be a little faster if you iterate i from sqrt_root to 0 due to the data characteristics.

Complexity Analysis

Assume NN is the length of arr.

Time complexity: \mathcal{O}(N\sqrt{N})O(N 
N
​	
 ) since we spend \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})O( 
N
​	
 ) at most for each dfs call, and there are \mathcal{O}({N})O(N) dfs calls in total.

Space complexity: \mathcal{O}(N)O(N) since we need spaces of \mathcal{O}(N)O(N) to store the result of dfs.

Approach 2: DP
Intuition

DFS with memorization is very similar to dp. We can also use dp to solve this problem.

We can just use a single dp[i] array to store whether the player now removing stones wins with i stones remaining.

Algorithm

Let dp[i] represents the result of the game with i stones. dp[i]==True means the current player must win, and dp[i]==False means the current player must lose, when both players play optimally.

The next step is to find out how to calculate dp[i].

We can iterate all possible movements, and check if we can move to a False state. If we can, then we found a must-win strategy, otherwise, we must lose since the opponent has a must-win strategy in this case.

More clearly, we can iterate k from 0 and check if there exists dp[i - k*k]==False. Of course, i - k*k >= 0.

Finally, we only need to return dp[n].

Note: After reading the Algorithm part, it is recommended to try to write the code on your own before reading the solution code.


```java
class Solution {
    public boolean winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int k = 1; k * k <= i; k++) {
                if (dp[i - k * k] == false) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
Also, we can employ DP in a slightly different way.

Intuition

Let's think in the backtrack way. If we have a state i that we know the current player must lose, what can we infer?

-- Any other states that can go to i must be True.

Let's say in another state j the current player in j can go to i by removing stones. In this case, the state j is True since the current player must win.

How to find all the state j? Well, we can iterate over the square numbers and add them to i.

Algorithm

Still, let dp[i] represent the result of the game of i stones. dp[i]==True means the first player (Alice) must win, and dp[i]==False means the second player (Bob) must win when both players play optimally.

When we get to a False state, we mark all accessible states as True. When we get to a True state, just continue (Why? Well... because it's useless).

Finally, we only need to return dp[n].

Note: After reading the Algorithm part, it is recommended to try to write the code on your own before reading the solution code.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            if (dp[i]) {
                continue;
            }
            for (int k = 1; i + k * k <= n; k++) {
                dp[i + k * k] = true;
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis

Assume NN is the length of arr.

Time complexity: \mathcal{O}(N\sqrt{N})O(N 
N
​	
 ) since we iterate over the dp array and spend \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})O( 
N
​	
 ) at most on each element.

Space complexity: \mathcal{O}(N)O(N) since we need a dp array.
