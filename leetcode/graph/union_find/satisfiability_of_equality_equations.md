### [990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations](https://leetcode.com/problems/satisfiability-of-equality-equations/)


Given an array equations of strings that represent relationships between variables, each string equations[i] has length 4 and takes one of two different forms: "a==b" or "a!=b".  Here, a and b are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return true if and only if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations.



Example 1:
```
Input: ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.  There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: ["a==b","b==c","a==c"]
Output: true
```
Example 4:
```
Input: ["a==b","b!=c","c==a"]
Output: false
```
Example 5:
```
Input: ["c==c","b==d","x!=z"]
Output: true
``` 

Note:

- 1 <= equations.length <= 500
- equations[i].length == 4
- equations[i][0] and equations[i][3] are lowercase letters
- equations[i][1] is either '=' or '!'
- equations[i][2] is '='
